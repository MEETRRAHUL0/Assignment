about bikes, adventures and fuuuuun set them apart from the era’s preening indie acts. Their wild gigs were heavy on puking and
punching. More than once, Pearl and her bandmates had to fight off stage invaders trying to grab her. She tried to emulate Iggy
Pop.

from the constraints of school, controlling boys and gender norms.
